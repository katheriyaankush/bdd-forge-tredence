Feature: Mobile User Login Fix

  In order to access their accounts,
  As a mobile user,
  I want to log in successfully without issues.

  Background:
    Given the user has a mobile device
    And the user has the latest version of the app

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given the user navigates to the login screen
    When the user enters valid username and password
    And taps on the login button
    Then the user should be redirected to the home screen
    And a welcome message should be displayed

  Scenario: Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials
    Given the user navigates to the login screen
    When the user enters invalid username or password
    And taps on the login button
    Then an error message should be displayed indicating invalid credentials
    And the user should remain on the login screen

  Scenario: Login attempt with empty fields
    Given the user navigates to the login screen
    When the user leaves username and password fields empty
    And taps on the login button
    Then an error message should be displayed indicating that fields cannot be empty
    And the user should remain on the login screen

  Scenario: Password reset link on login page
    Given the user navigates to the login screen
    When the user taps on the "Forgot Password?" link
    Then the user should be redirected to the password reset page

  Scenario: Responsive design for login screen
    Given the user opens the login screen on a mobile device
    Then the login screen should be optimized for mobile view
    And all elements should be properly aligned and accessible

  Scenario: Network failure during login attempt
    Given the user navigates to the login screen
    When the user enters valid username and password
    And taps on the login button with no internet connection
    Then an error message should be displayed indicating network failure
    And the user should remain on the login screen
