Below are the JavaScript step definition functions for the provided BDD test cases. These functions are structured to be reusable and maintainable, allowing for easy updates and modifications.

});

Given('the user is viewing their dashboard', async function () {

### Explanation:
1. **Organization**: The code is organized into sections where helper functions are created to manage user actions and assertions.
2. **Async/Await**: Asynchronous programming is used for operations that might require time, such as navigating the dashboard or checking for updates.
3. **Reusability**: Functions are modular, which allows for easy reuse across different scenarios and easier updates.
4. **Readability**: Comments are added where necessary to explain the purpose of each function, and logical names are used to enhance readability.
